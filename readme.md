A20 goes Klipper
================

As i changed my Geetech A20 from 2020 to klipper i was wondering that I didn't find a working printer.cfg for my printer.

So i had to do a lot of reseach and reverse-engineering the Marlin source to make it work.

Therefore if you have the same Issue just download and hope it works for your Machine.

**Special Thanks goes to Markus Ahamer who was a great help at this point.**

My Printer has:
- GT2560 Board V3.0
- 12864 DISPLAY Type ST7920 (The Original one)
- BL Touch V3.2
